Planning Phase 4: SEO & Performans Optimizasyonu

Context gathering complete. About to spawn gsd-phase-researcher agent when user interrupted.

- Phase directory exists: .planning/phases/04-seo-&-performans-optimizasyonu/
- CONTEXT.md created with user decisions (meta approach, sitemap strategy, performance priorities)
- No existing RESEARCH.md or PLAN.md files
- Model profile: "budget" (researcher=haiku, planner=sonnet, checker=haiku)
- workflow.research = true (config.json)
- workflow.plan_check = true
</current_state>

<completed_work>

**Earlier this session:**
- Phase 3 execution completed and verified (4/4 must-haves passed)
- ROADMAP.md, STATE.md, REQUIREMENTS.md updated
- Phase 3 completion committed: docs(03): complete Phase 3

**This session:**
- Ran /gsd:discuss-phase 4
- User selected "You decide all" for gray areas
- Created 04-CONTEXT.md with Claude's discretion on SEO/performance decisions
- CONTEXT.md committed: docs(04): capture phase context
- Started /gsd:plan-phase 4
- Loaded all context files (ROADMAP, STATE, REQUIREMENTS, CONTEXT)
- About to spawn researcher when user interrupted

</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

**Plan Phase 4 workflow:**

1. ☐ Spawn gsd-phase-researcher (haiku) - was interrupted here
2. ☐ Researcher creates 04-RESEARCH.md
3. ☐ Check for existing plans (none exist)
4. ☐ Spawn gsd-planner (sonnet) with all context
5. ☐ Planner creates PLAN.md files
6. ☐ Spawn gsd-plan-checker (haiku) to verify plans
7. ☐ Revision loop if needed (max 3 iterations)
8. ☐ Present final status with /gsd:execute-phase next step

**Phase 4 Context decisions (locked):**
- Hybrid metadata approach (centralized config + per-page overrides)
- SEO keyword focused titles: `[Service] Hizmeti | [Location] | Moka Dijital`
- 150-160 char meta descriptions with benefit + CTA
- Basic OG tags, single fallback image
- Sitemap with all 7 static pages, build-time generation
- Allow all bots in robots.txt
- Use existing next-export-optimize-images, next/font, lazy loading

**Claude's Discretion areas:**
- Exact meta description wording per service
- Specific performance targets
- Additional meta tags (twitter:card, etc.)

</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

**User explicitly chose "You decide all"** for SEO/performance decisions
- No specific user preferences beyond CONTEXT.md locked decisions
- Use SEO best practices for Turkish market
- Use Next.js static export best practices

**Key technical context:**
- Next.js 15.1.6 with `output: 'export'` for static export
- PHP hosting deployment target
- Turkish language content (lang='tr')
- Existing service pages: /hizmetler/google-isletme, /hizmetler/seo, /hizmetler/pmk, /hizmetler/web-gelistirme, /hizmetler/reklam, /hizmetler/otomasyon
- next-export-optimize-images plugin already installed

</decisions_made>

<blockers>

None. User interrupted - no technical blockers.

</blockers>

<context>

**The plan:**
1. Research phase to understand Next.js 15 metadata API, sitemap generation, robots.txt, Turkish SEO, performance optimization
2. Create executable plans for:
   - Meta data implementation (metadata config, per-page overrides)
   - Sitemap and robots.txt generation
   - Performance optimizations (fonts, lazy loading, CWV)
3. Verify plans honor locked decisions from CONTEXT.md
4. Present plans for execution

**Mental state:**
Ready to spawn researcher. All context files loaded. Model profile resolved (budget). Just need to execute Task() call to gsd-phase-researcher.

</context>

<next_action>

**Resume with:**
`/gsd:plan-phase 4`

**First step:** Spawn gsd-phase-researcher with haiku model to create 04-RESEARCH.md

**Prompt already prepared:**
- Research how to implement metadata, sitemap, robots.txt in Next.js 15 static export
- Cover Turkish SEO best practices
- Cover performance optimizations (next/font, lazy loading, CWV)
- Write to: .planning/phases/04-seo-&-performans-optimizasyonu/04-RESEARCH.md

**Alternative:** Use `/gsd:plan-phase 4 --skip-research` to go directly to planning without research
